					</header>
					<h3>Background</h3>
					<p>Bizni was created by a group of interns at the <a target="_blank" href="http://grandcentraltech.com/">Grand Central Tech Innovation</a> project as a response to the challenge of the Business to Business (B2B) payment problem.  Communication and responsiveness is key; without these, invoices often go unpaid and relationships become strained.  Bizni aims to eliminate these problems through an all in one style platform where businesses small and large can come together in an open, honest, and easy environment.</p>
